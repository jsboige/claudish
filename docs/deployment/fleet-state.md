# Fleet State Manifest (non-secret)

Change-control surface for the claudish fleet coordinator (user mandate 2026-09-07).
Each machine's **effective** deployment state lives here, updated by its operator after
every change, corroborated by the coordinator where measurable.

Rules:

- **No secrets.** API keys, proxy keys, OAuth tokens: never. Fingerprints only (sha256, 8 chars max).
- Every armed-state change (cascade, upstream, ports, capture, image) = a commit to this
  file **plus** a note on the workspace dashboard.
- Qualifiers: `VERIFIED` (who measured, when) vs `DECLARED` (operator statement, date).
  A declaration is accepted until contradicted; the coordinator corroborates what is
  measurable from ai-01 (`/health` of hub/relay/sidecar, sidecar logs).
- The coordinator validates infra/traffic-affecting changes **ex-ante** (`[PROPOSAL]` →
  `[ACK]` on the dashboard); emergencies are validated ex-post with a post-mortem ≤ 1h.
  Post-restart/recreate proof obligations (≤ 15 min): startup line
  `[Failover] configured=N auto=on`, `/health`, `test -f` on every file bind,
  relay NOMINAL as seen by po-203.

## po-2025 — HUB (canonical since 05/09 cutover)

| Item | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Deploy dir | `D:\claudish-shadow` | DECLARED 07/09 |
| Recreate command | drained recreate with `--env-file D:\claudish-shadow\.env` | DECLARED 07/09 |
| ⚠ Trap | plain `up -d` loads `D:\dev\claudish\.env` (1 line) → **cascades EMPTY** | VERIFIED by incident 07/09 |
| Cascades | configured=3, auto=1 — SONNET mistral→qwen→PAYG · OPUS qwen→gc→PAYG · HAIKU qwen→PAYG · `ROLE_MODELS` set · `QWEN_THINKING=budget:4096` | DECLARED 07/09 14:01Z (startup line quoted) |

| Restart epochs 07/09 | ~08:06Z · 13:59Z (incident repair) | VERIFIED (uptime probes) |

Incident 07/09: bind source `codex-oauth.json` recreated as an empty **directory** by
Docker → EISDIR → Codex 401s; repair bind file-over-directory → container
Created-never-started → fleet down 13:26→13:59Z; first repair `up -d` silently emptied
the cascades. Post-mortem: workspace dashboard 14:01Z (format of reference).

## po-2023 — RELAY

| Item | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role | Relay → po-2025 via host TCP forwarder `:18182` | VERIFIED (settings + relay logs) |
| Endpoint | `192.168.0.46:3000` (LAN) | VERIFIED 07/09 (ai-01 `/health`) |
| `ClaudishDailyRestart` 04:00 | DISABLED (05/09, user UAC) | VERIFIED 09/10 (po-2023: `State=Disabled`, `LastRunTime 05/09 04:00:01`, `LastTaskResult 0`) |
| Cascade | auto; haiku→DeepSeek v4 Flash PAYG observed armed + recovered 07/09 | VERIFIED (po-203 cycles) |
| Sidecar native `:8787` | restarted (fix #3388) | DECLARED 06/09 |
| **Client path** (live `~/.claude/settings.json`) | `env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = http://192.168.0.50:3000` — hub **direct**, bypasses this relay. `_intentional_diffs.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` still declares `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (this relay) → **contradiction open with the user** (Q-20261006-1; #291 c.6018454098) | VERIFIED 09/10 07:20Z (po-203 cycle) |
| **WAN edge** `models.myia.io` (IIS site 49, hosted on po-2023) | reverse-proxy target `http://192.168.0.50:3000` — hub **direct**, relay bypassed. web.config mtime **2026-10-04 21:24 local**, sha256 `7ADE6AD6` — **unchanged since the 08/10 measurement** (no silent revert; the 30/09 state `localhost:3000` no longer holds) | VERIFIED 09/10 07:20Z (live web.config + `applicationHost.config`) |
| **Edge client population** (09/10, full day 00:00→15:08Z, 9911 req) | 2 off-site `claude-cli` **cron** clients (2350 + 71 real `/v1/messages`) · the **hairpin** `Bun/1.3.14` instance (LAN-internal, ~10 s `/health` cadence until 10Z then ~5 s; it also issues `/v1/messages` — so it is a claudish instance, not a bare prober; **source still unattributable from po-203**) · ~40 internet scanner hits (Palo Alto Xpanse, `/.env`) | VERIFIED 09/10 (W3SVC49 log) |
| **WAN path has no fallback — measured cost** | Full day: **41× 502** on the edge, incl. bursts 12:54–12:55Z and 13:05–13:08Z and 4× at 14:29–14:42Z, hitting **real inference** (`/v1/messages`) of our own cron clients and the hairpin instance. The hub restarted mid-day (`instanceId` `082ebb60` → **`5d09f9eb`, started 13:07:28Z**, aligned to the second with the 13:05–13:08Z burst). With the edge on the hub **direct**, there is nothing between the client and the hub to absorb that window; the relay's AUTONOMOUS mode (13 cascades armed) would have served it locally had the edge still pointed at `.46`. **This inverts the "relay bypass costs nothing" reading of the 07:20Z measurement** — it costs nothing on a quiet day and 41× 502 on a bad one | VERIFIED 09/10 15:08Z (`/health` instanceId change + W3SVC49 log) |
| **Population served by this relay** | **probes only** — its own watchdog heartbeat + deep probe. No client transits it on either path: local clients go `.50` direct, and so does the WAN edge | VERIFIED 09/10 07:20Z (`/health` `relay-nominal` + edge/relay logs) |

## ai-01 — COORDINATOR + sidecar

| Item | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sidecar | `localhost:3002` (+ NanoClaw portproxy `0.0.0.0:13000` → `127.0.0.1:3002`), upstream **`http://192.168.0.50:3000`** (direct to hub — double-hop removed); image `01454736`, built from `main` `61c3d2d` (carries the #218 native pin, predates #225/#226) | VERIFIED 23/09 04:16Z (drained recreate; `/health` `relay-nominal` on :3002 **and** :13000) |
| Deploy | compose in `D:\claudish` + override (SearXNG URL), env file `D:\claudish\.env`; recreate = `claudish-drain.ps1 -ContainerName claudish-sidecar -Recreate -EnvFile D:\claudish\.env`. ⚠ that `.env` is now armed: never run `bun test` from `D:\claudish` (Bun auto-loads it) | VERIFIED 23/09 |

Each step measured to resolve **on ai-01** before the gesture (throwaway HUB container on `127.0.0.1:3999`, 3/3 `message_stop`, removed after) | VERIFIED 23/09 04:16Z |
| Role map | profile `default`: opus `claude-opus-5-5` (was `claude-opus-4-8`), sonnet `glm-5.2`, haiku `mmc@MiniMax-M3`; native pin read in-container: `claude-opus-5` and `claude-opus-4-8` → `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-opus-5-5` and `glm-5.2` unchanged | VERIFIED 23/09 |

| Capture | on (outage trail) | VERIFIED |

## po-2026 — SIDECAR (bypassed by its own client)

| Item | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sidecar | `claudish-proxy`, `0.0.0.0:3000`, healthy, image pre-#159 (`role` absent from `/health`) | VERIFIED 23/09 (docker inspect + `/health`) |
| Compose dir | **`C:\dev\claudish` — a second clone, not the dev tree `D:\Dev\claudish`**; the `.env` that governs the container lives there | VERIFIED 23/09 (container label `com.docker.compose.project.working_dir`) |
| Upstream | `CLAUDISH_RELAY_UPSTREAM=http://192.168.0.46:3000` (po-2023, the pre-migration hub) in **both** the compose `.env` (mtime 26/07) **and** the live container env — the runbook's "repointed `.46`→`.50` by hand on 2026-09-13" never landed on this machine | VERIFIED 23/09 (file read + `docker inspect` env) |
| Cascades | **0 armed by value** (`grep -cE 'CLAUDISH_FAILOVER_[A-Z0-9_]+=.+'` on container env = 0); `ROLE_MODELS` empty | VERIFIED 23/09 |
| Client | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://192.168.0.50:3000` **direct to hub** (settings.json + live process env) — the sidecar serves zero streams; the stale upstream is latent, not load-bearing | VERIFIED 23/09 (process env + `activeStreams=0`) |
| Plan | repoint `.46`→`.50` at the next **planned drained recreate**, via `[PROPOSAL]` + single ACK (coordinator arbitration 22/09 23:36Z) — never as an isolated gesture on an unused container | DECLARED (coordinator dispatch) |

## Change log

| Date (Z) | Machine | Change | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-09 07:20 | po-2023 | **path witness re-read, read-only — no gesture applied** (#291 grain 3): edge backend `192.168.0.50:3000` unchanged (mtime 04/10 21:24, sha `7ADE6AD6`), client `env` still hub-direct vs the relay-declaring `_intentional_diffs`, relay serves probes only | live web.config + `applicationHost.config` + `settings.json` + W3SVC49 log + `/health` probes on both relay and hub |
| 2026-10-09 15:08 | po-2023 | **same-day correction, read-only**: the 07:20Z reading understated the day — edge closed at **41× 502** (bursts 12:54Z, 13:05–13:08Z, 14:29–14:42Z) on real `/v1/messages` traffic, after a **hub restart at 13:07:28Z** (`instanceId` `082ebb60`→`5d09f9eb`). The relay-bypass is free on a quiet day and costs 41× 502 on a bad one | `/health` instanceId change + full-day W3SVC49 log |
| 2026-10-08 10:09:58 local | po-2025 | `ClaudishDailyRestart` (04:00) **deleted** — user UAC batch v2, gesture G1; the user arbitrated "no daily restart". Last run 08/10 07:31 local → `OUTCOME success` | DECLARED by po-2025; absence re-confirmed 10:19:35 local. With po-2023's disabled since 05/09, **no daily restart remains on the fleet** |
| 2026-09-23 04:16 | ai-01 | drained recreate under po-2025's `[ACK]` (single-ACK rule), plan posted 04:12Z: image rebuilt from `61c3d2d`, opus map → `claude-opus-5-5`, sonnet cascade armed (3 steps) + `ROLE_MODELS=glm-5.2:sonnet`. Drain: 0 in flight | precondition 3/3 on a throwaway container; `/health` :3002 + :13000; real tool-call turn to `message_stop` with local capture count unchanged (NOMINAL); in-container pin; armed by value = 3 |
| 2026-09-23 | po-2026 | state audited on-boarding (no change applied): sidecar still on pre-migration upstream `.46` (file + container), 0 cascades armed, client bypasses it direct to `.50`; runbook's 13/09 repoint claim corrected — it never landed; compose dir is a second clone (`C:\dev\claudish`) | section above (all items VERIFIED 23/09) |
| 2026-09-07 23:12 | ai-01 | sidecar recreated: `CLAUDISH_RELAY_UPSTREAM` `.46` → `.50`. Double-hop removed. Under the user's fleet-wide rollout GO (07/09 ~22:10Z) | startup `[Relay] sidecar mode: upstream=http://192.168.0.50:3000` + `docker inspect` env + `/health` + egress `curl` **from inside the container** to `.50` |
| 2026-09-07 22:16 | ai-01 | sidecar auto-restarted by the Docker daemon coming back up — **kept the OLD `.46` env**: a start does not reload `.env`, only a recreate does | `docker inspect` env vs on-disk `.env` (2 h of divergence, 17 header-timeout local fallbacks in the window) |
| 2026-09-07 21:33 | ai-01 | Docker Desktop back up after the deliberate stop (CoursIA runners) — 47 containers with `StartedAt` inside 0.4 s = host/daemon event, not a targeted gesture | `docker inspect .State.StartedAt` across all containers |
| 2026-09-07 13:59 | po-2025 | incident repair: drained recreate with correct `--env-file`, cascades restored, OAuth file bind | startup line + `/health` (DECLARED, corroborated ai-01 14:05Z) |
| 2026-09-07 ~08:06 | po-2025 | restart (cause TBD — post-mortem pending) | uptime probe ai-01 |
