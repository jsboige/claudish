/**
 * #304 → #310 — static cross-check: every CLAUDISH_* env name the code READS
 * must be injected by docker-compose.yml's `environment:` list, unless it is
 * explicitly exempted below as not-for-containers.
 *
 * The compose `environment:` list is an explicit allowlist: the env file is
 * used for interpolation only, so a knob written there for a name the list
 * does not carry never reaches the process — the proxy runs on its defaults
 * whatever the operator wrote. That is how five #91/#293 failover knobs and
 * the #218 kill switch shipped documented but unreachable (#304); #310
 * widened the check from the failover family to all CLAUDISH_* names and
 * found the same state for 22 more runtime knobs, including the two
 * never-hang kill switches (FIRST_EVENT_TIMEOUT_MS, PREVISIBLE_REFORWARD_MAX)
 * and the key-rotation overlap (PROXY_KEY_PREVIOUS).
 *
 * What this test pins, in both directions:
 *   1. code → compose: every name read in production sources (tests excluded)
 *      appears in the compose list, or carries an entry in EXEMPT below with
 *      the reason it is not for containers. The default for a NEW name is
 *      "must be injected" — adding a read without a compose line (or an
 *      exemption) fails this test.
 *   2. compose → code: every CLAUDISH_* name in the compose list is read by
 *      the code — a renamed knob would otherwise leave a dead compose line
 *      that looks configurable and is not.
 *
 * Read shapes covered: `.NAME` dot access on `process.env` (or the `env`
 * parameter objects that carry it), `["NAME"]` bracket access with a literal
 * string, and the failover dynamic templates (`env[`CLAUDISH_FAILOVER_${role}`]`,
 * `env[`${key}_LABEL`]`). The templates cannot be extracted as literals, so
 * the closed role set {OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU,FABLE} is resolved here, and the
 * resolution is itself pinned: if FAILOVER_ROLES ever grows a fifth role, the
 * bare-role anchor assertion below fails and forces the family (and compose)
 * to follow.
 *
 * Positive controls (a detector that silently matches nothing proves nothing):
 *   - the compose parser must find the known 23-name family (parser alive);
 *   - the code scan must collect a broad, named population (scanner alive);
 *   - the bracket shape is proven on a synthetic fixture — zero production
 *     sites use it today, so only a fixture keeps the shape from silently
 *     rotting until the first real `process.env["CLAUDISH_…"]` appears;
 *   - the gap checker must report a name on a synthetic compose that lacks it
 *     (verdict alive — the mutation, run as a fixture so the real repository
 *     is never touched).
