/**
 * Who owns the exit on SIGTERM — and why the proxy's graceful shutdown was
 * unreachable until it did.
 *
 * `stats-buffer.ts` registers a synchronous SIGTERM/SIGINT listener at module
 * evaluation time. The proxy entrypoint reaches it through a plain static
 * import chain (standalone-proxy -> proxy-server -> composed-handler -> stats
 * -> stats-buffer), and a module body is evaluated before its importer's, so
 * that listener is always registered FIRST. Node runs signal listeners
 * synchronously in registration order, and `process.exit()` does not return —
 * so an unconditional exit there meant `await server.shutdown()` in
 * standalone-proxy.ts never ran, and every restart cut the in-flight SSE
 * responses mid-body (`Connection lost mid-response`, client-side).
 *
 * WHAT THESE TESTS DO AND DO NOT PROVE. They drive the listener array with
 * `process.emit("SIGTERM")` rather than a real signal, on purpose: on Windows
 * `process.kill(process.pid, "SIGTERM")` is a TerminateProcess and delivers no
 * JS signal at all, so a signal-based test would measure the OS on one platform
 * and our code on another. What is exercised is exactly what changed — listener
 * ordering and the ownership decision. Delivering the signal to PID 1 in the
 * container is the runtime's job, not ours.
