/**
 * Failover — role-level model substitution as a transitive cascade of degradations,
 * with explicit onset + recovery notices.
 *
 * This is NOT `FallbackHandler` (handlers/fallback-handler.ts). That one swaps
 * *providers* for the *same* model when a provider is unhealthy — a transport
 * concern. This one swaps the *model itself* for a whole role (opus/sonnet/haiku/fable)
 * when the nominal model's budget is exhausted — a subscription concern.
 *
 * Each role has an ORDERED CASCADE of substitutes, `>`-separated in env. Walls are
 * per PROVIDER BUCKET (#275): a refusal walls the meter the refusing nominal draws
 * on, and only requests whose own nominal sits in a walled bucket divert — the
 * maxing of one provider never contaminates another role's healthy nominal.
 *
 *   CLAUDISH_FAILOVER_OPUS=qwen-token-plan@qwen3.8-max>gc@glm-5.2>deepseek@deepseek-payg
 *   CLAUDISH_FAILOVER_OPUS_LABEL=Qwen 3.8 Max>GLM-5.2>DeepSeek PAYG
 *   CLAUDISH_FAILOVER_OPUS_DIRECTION=degraded>degraded>improved
 *
 * "Opus → Qwen 3.8 → GLM" is nominal-tier cascade behaviour, not a set of special
 * routes: when the nominal walls, serve step 0; when step 0 ALSO walls, serve step
 * 1; and so on. A single value (no `>`) is a 1-step cascade — the historical config
 * parses unchanged. The last step (typically PAYG) is always served when everything
 * above it is down: a pay-per-use target should not wall, and its real error beats a
 * synthetic one.
 *
 * Per-step TTL with exponential backoff (BACKOFF_MS) avoids re-probing a weekly wall
 * every 10 min (Qwen: ~6 probes over 6 days) while GLM's rolling 5h window self-heals
 * (10m+30m+1h+4h ≈ 5h30 lands a probe right after it restarts). Step-failure state is
 * deliberately INDEPENDENT of the role-level auto-arm TTL: the 10-min nominal re-probe
 * cycle must not re-probe a weekly-walled step every time it fires.
 *
 * Two notices, two moments (the user's mandate 2026-08-12):
 *  - Moment of failover/recovery (streaming, once per session per resolved depth): the
 *    substitute (or back-to-nominal) model reads its own prior turn starting with the
 *    notice, so it knows the capability delta and resumes its normal working scope.
 *  - Condensation (/compact, every time): re-injected because compaction rebuilds
 *    context and loses the prior notice. Onset persists while armed; RECOVERY persists
 *    RECOVERY_CONDENSATIONS times so the model can "corriger ses mémoires et se
 *    remettre en rythme nominal."
 *
 * Recovery detection = the auto-arm TTL probe. An armed role's auto-arm expires after
 * AUTO_ARM_TTL_MS; the next request serves nominal; if nominal answers, the role
 * transitions to RECOVERING and notices fire. Config-arms (operator-held) do not
 * self-probe — their recovery is operator-initiated. Now that NativeHandler propagates
 * upstream status (commit 30a974f), auto-arm works on Anthropic-native, so the
 * historical reason to config-arm Opus is gone — auto-arm is the default path and
 * Friday-03h-style resets self-detect.

 * a concrete target — plus one exclusion of the walk's own: a step whose

 * mirror the loop's SUCCESS bookkeeping on a served attempt (`resetStepSuccess`,
