/**
 * Stdout marker line builders — the traffic-format contract's single source
 * (claudish #72 grain 1, roo-extensions #3391 mirror).
 *
 * `docker logs` stdout is the wire two consumer families parse:
 *  - the MCP tool `claudish_traffic` (roo-state-manager,
 *    mcps/internal/servers/roo-state-manager/src/tools/claudish-traffic.ts)
 *    field-parses `[Request]` lines and lifecycle banners;
 *  - the traffic-*.ps1 scripts and every ad-hoc `grep '\[ttft\]'` count/join
 *    `[resp]` / `[ttft]` lines, keyed by reqN (request-based attribution only:
 *    these lines carry NO machine=).
 *
 * The `[ttft]` template used to exist as THREE inline copies (openai-sse,
 * anthropic-sse, openai-responses-sse) — identical modulo the parser label,
 * each free to drift alone. They now all call ttftMarkerLine, and the
 * producer-side pinning test (fork/middleware/traffic-format-producer.test.ts)
 * holds builders and `__fixtures__/traffic-format/` files to the exact shape,
 * so a format change fails HERE, in the emitting repo — not in the consumer
 * repo weeks later (the #3391 lesson: the parser lives elsewhere, the breakage
 * must be visible at the producer).

/**
 * First-upstream-event marker. Emitted once per stream, on the first `data:`
 * line the parser sees.
 *
 *   `  [ttft] <label> model=<model> reqN=<n> headers=<hdr>ms firstEvent=<fe>ms total=<hdr+fe>ms`
 *
 * - `label` is the PARSER id (openai | anthropic | responses), not the
 *   provider billed — a GLM on the anthropic wire logs `[ttft] anthropic`.
 * - `headers` is dispatch → upstream response headers; `-1` means "not
 *   measured" and MUST also force `total=-1` (never a bogus sum with -1).
 * - On a NOMINAL relay these are the ONLY per-request volume lines (a forwarded
 *   request writes no capture and no [Request] line) — the field order and
 *   units are load-bearing for every latency histogram built from them.
