/**
 * Stream start peek — classify the first bytes of an SSE response without
 * consuming the stream the parser will later read.
 *
 * Motivation: Z.AI (anthropic-sse transport) frequently delivers its burst /
 * RPM limit as **HTTP 200** followed by an in-stream SSE error ([1302]) that
 * carries no message envelope. That is invisible to `response.ok` and to
 * FallbackHandler (both key off HTTP status), so it used to flow straight to
 * the client as a bare error and crash the turn. By peeking the first bytes we
 * can detect the rate-limit before handing the body to the parser, temporize
 * (retry the same provider — the sustained quota has headroom, only the
 * instantaneous burst limit is hit), and on persistence fall back to the next
 * provider in the chain.
 *
 * Mechanism: `ReadableStream.tee()` splits the body into two independent
 * branches. We sniff branch A and hand branch B (a pristine, full copy
 * including the prefix we read) downstream. Tee buffers internally, so no bytes
 * are lost for branch B even though we consumed branch A.
 *
 * Timing: the rate-limit errors we target arrive in 0-4ms. A short bounded
 * window therefore catches them while leaving slow-but-healthy responses (a
 * big-context cache-miss can have a multi-second TTFB) to proceed untouched.
 *
 * Fail-open: any unexpected condition (no body, tee unsupported, read error,
 * timeout) resolves to "healthy" with a usable Response, so this never makes
 * things worse than the parser-level safety net already guarantees.
