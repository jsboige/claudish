 * `AbortSignal.timeout(...)` rejects with a `DOMException` whose `name` is
 * `TimeoutError` and whose `code` is the NUMBER 23 — so `findConnectionCode`'s
 * `typeof e.code === "string"` test skipped it, its message ("The operation
 * timed out.") matched no fallback, and classification returned **null**. A
 * REACHABILITY PROBE that hung therefore fell straight through into a bare
 * 500, with none of the actionable wording every other unreachable-host
 * failure gets.
 *
 * ── WHY THE NAME ALONE IS NOT THE DISCRIMINATOR ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * `TimeoutError` is also what a TRANSPORT'S OWN request ceiling rejects with.
 * `vertex-oauth.ts` puts `AbortSignal.timeout(30000)` on the *inference* call
 * and `local.ts` a ten-minute one. Classifying by name alone turned "the model
 * took longer than its transport's ceiling" — a LATENCY event, ordinary for a
 * thinking model on a streaming endpoint — into `unreachable`: it entered the
 * retry ladder, took the tier-2 handoff, and with `CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG`
 * on it was re-POSTed ~300 times, each one running ONE MORE REAL BILLED
 * INFERENCE against a host that had answered the TCP connect and was already
 * generating. RISK-6 (`network-recovery.md` §7) was accepted for
 * `ECONNRESET`/`EPIPE` on a genuine network fault. It was never accepted for a
 * latency event, which is neither a network fault nor transient — and
 * `buildConnectionErrorMessage` then told the user to check their VPN and DNS
 * for a host that was mid-generation.
 *
 * So the discriminator is the SIGNAL'S ORIGIN, carried on the error as an own
 * property, not the name:
 *
 *   - the ladder's per-attempt clamp (`transient-retry.ts`) — WE gave up on
 *     this attempt, and re-issuing is the entire point;
 *   - a reachability PROBE we issued with our own short timeout (`local.ts`'s
 *     5 s `/api/tags`) — WE asked "is anything there" and got no answer.
 *
 * Both mean "we could not get a response out of this host inside a window WE
 * chose". A transport's inference ceiling means something else, so it keeps
 * its pre-recovery route out of here: unclassified, rethrown, untouched.
 *
 * ONLY `TimeoutError`. `AbortError` is deliberately absent and must stay
 * absent: it is how a client says it has gone away and how our own per-attempt
 * clamp's sibling signal reports a deliberate cancellation, and treating a
 * cancellation as a network fault would retry work nobody is waiting for.
