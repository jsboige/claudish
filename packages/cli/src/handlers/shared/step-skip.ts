/**
 * Step-skip signal — #431: how a cascade step says "I cannot take THIS request".
 *
 * Two measured shapes, one wire: a vLLM-style endpoint REFUSES a prompt whose
 * `prompt + max_tokens` exceeds `--max-model-len` (measured on the Swift lane,
 * v0.31: HTTP 400 "maximum context length", never trims), and a saturated
 * `ConcurrencyLimiter` holds the turn in an unbounded FIFO before any fetch —
 * the first-event watchdog never sees it. Both used to surface as the client's
 * answer: the overflow as a recovery turn (the compaction notice read as the
 * model's own words), the busy wait as a hang.
 *
 * The signal is a response header, `x-claudish-step-skip`, set by
 * ComposedHandler on exactly those two responses:
 *   - `context` on the overflow recovery turn (classified from upstream OR
 *     short-circuited by the learned cap), with `est=`/`cap=` detail for the
 *     countable marker;
 *   - `busy` on the bounded 529 the handler answers when the step attempt's
 *     concurrency wait expires, with `wait=`/`label=` detail.
 *
 * Only `handleWithCascade` ACTS on it, and only for a non-last cascade step
 * with a successor: advance (skip), no failure mark, no dwell pin on the
 * skipped step. Everywhere else — nominal, last step, non-cascade path,
 * keyless — the response surfaces unchanged, header and all (same doctrine as
 * `x-claudish-failover-notice`, #229: a namespaced diagnostic header is
 * harmless to a client that ignores it, and greppable for one that looks).
