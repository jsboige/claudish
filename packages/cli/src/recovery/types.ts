 * The shape of one outage, as the banner draws it.

 * No imports, deliberately: the coordinator builds this and `magmux-ui.ts`
 * reads it, and neither should drag the other's dependencies along.
 *
 * FRAMES ARE FAT ON PURPOSE. One frame carries the whole banner — provider,
 * host, endpoint, reason sentence, counters, the next-attempt instant — so the
 * banner can be drawn from a single value with nothing to look up.
 *
 * TIMESTAMPS HERE ARE EPOCH MS (`Date.now()`), named `…AtMs`. Everything the
 * coordinator measures intervals with is process ms (`performance.now()`) and is
 * converted exactly once, in `renderableEpisodeFrame()`. A process-ms instant
 * drawn as a countdown is an arbitrary number with no error anywhere.
