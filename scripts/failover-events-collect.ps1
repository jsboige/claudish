# Claudish failover-events collector — writes the proxy's [Failover] lines to
# a file, because a recreate destroys both the docker log and process memory.
#
# WHY (jsboige/claudish#347, from #331 Q2). The hub's failover markers (ARMED /
# DISARMED / walled / failed / DWELL / CLOSED / RECOVERED) live only in
# `docker logs` and in the failover state's process memory. A recreate
# destroys both, walls and all: the 04/10 window that produced the "408 walls
# on haiku[1]" was lost at the 05/10 07:58:44Z recreate, so the breakdown
# #331 asks for can no longer be rebuilt — and failed cascade attempts leave
# no resp-* capture either (0 *kimi* files on 04/10 and 05/10 although the
# Kimi step walled on both days). Any past-window question about walls dies at
# the next recreate. This file is where they survive.
#
# IT WRITES `[Failover]` LINES ONLY, AND THAT IS A SECURITY PROPERTY (the
# #192 lesson, applied from the start rather than after an incident): a
# `docker logs` window contains request lines, body previews with user text,
# and Authorization-looking strings. The allowlist is the exact token
# `[Failover]` — enforced at the SINK (Select-FailoverLines), testable with no
# docker at all, so a line without the marker never reaches the file whatever
# the daemon hands back. Widening the capture to other markers is deliberately
# out of scope: each marker needs its own allowlist review.
#
# THERE IS NO ACTUATOR HERE, deliberately. Collecting is not acting (#173).
# A static test in scripts/tests/claudish-failover-events.Tests.ps1 walks
# this file's AST and refuses any Restart-*/Stop-*/docker stop|restart|kill|
# rm|compose/-Verb RunAs.
#
# RECREATE-SAFE BY NAME + ID: the container is addressed by NAME (the recreate
# keeps the name), and each tick probes /health for the per-process
# `instanceId` (#156) — a change is recorded in the state file's tick record,
# so a window that spans a recreate is visible from the file.
#
# DRY RUN before installing (Register-ScheduledTask has no -WhatIf):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <this file> -ClaudishHome $env:TEMP\fe-dry
# then inspect %TEMP%\fe-dry\failover-events.log + -state.json — the values
# are the ones the task will write, from the same code path. Only then:
#   schtasks /create /tn "ClaudishFailoverEvents" /tr "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File D:\Dev\claudish\scripts\failover-events-collect.ps1" /sc minute /mo 15 /ru SYSTEM /rl HIGHEST /f
# and verify by RE-READING the registered task (not by trusting the create):
#   schtasks /query /tn "ClaudishFailoverEvents" /v /fo list
# On a machine whose operator is not `jsboi`, append
#   -ClaudishHome C:\Users\<op>\.claudish  (and -HealthUrl when not :3000)
#
# Outputs, both under <ClaudishHome>:
#   failover-events.log         append-only NDJSON, one kept line per record:
#                               {ts, line, container, instanceId}
#   failover-events-state.json  last tick + bounded history + dedup ring
#
# The state file is what makes a DEAD collector distinguishable from a QUIET
# proxy: an empty log means nothing on its own (the grep -L-over-zero-bytes
# trap). One tick record per run, bounded — that history answers "was the
# collector even running at 03:49Z?" from a file.
#
# Targets PowerShell 5.1 (the scheduled task runs powershell, not pwsh).
