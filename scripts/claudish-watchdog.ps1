# Claudish Watchdog — detects tool-call stream hangs and auto-restarts
#
# The proxy hangs on tool_call paths (WebSearch, GLM tool_use), not simple text.
# This watchdog tests the EXACT code path that degrades:
#   1. A streaming request WITH tools defined (triggers tool_use in the model)
#   2. Checks that the stream completes within timeout
#   3. Also checks container uptime — proactive restart at 11h before degradation
#
# Every ambiguous stop logs one DIAG[...] line (Write-DiagLine): is the published
# port actually bound, and does the host have commit headroom. The 02/09 outage
# (host commit exhaustion — nothing listened on :3000, docker.exe would not
# launch) had to be reconstructed from the Windows event log after the fact;
# those two facts now self-classify the incident as it happens.

        The signature, confirmed three times on 2026-09-20: something is
        LISTENING on [::1]:<port> but never answers HTTP, while the serving path
        streams real tool calls. Container restarts do not fix it (13 tried);
        only the engine/WSL layer does.

        Default outcome on every machine is ESCALATE — log it and leave the host
        alone. Acting requires, in order: the opt-in file, a rebuild path proven
        in this same process, and the rate limit. Each gate is named in the log
        so an operator reads WHY nothing happened rather than guessing.

        This function must never throw. It runs after a successful health check,
        and a watchdog that turns a healthy cycle into a crash is worse than one
        that misses a wedge.
