.SYNOPSIS
  Nightly compaction of claudish diagnostic captures with 7-Zip.

.DESCRIPTION
  The claudish proxy writes raw request/response captures (req-*.json /
  resp-*.sse) into a flat directory bind-mounted from the container
  (CLAUDISH_CAPTURE_DIR=/captures -> D:\claudish-captures). These are text
  with massive cross-request redundancy (the same large system prompts and
  conversation histories repeat across thousands of files), so 7-Zip LZMA2
  compresses them ~30:1 or better.

  Left uncompressed, ~3-8 GB/day of loose files would fill the disk within
  months. This script packs every COMPLETED past day (UTC) into a single
  per-day .7z under <CaptureDir>\archive\, verifies the archive integrity,
  and ONLY THEN deletes the loose originals. The current day (and any extra
  days requested via -KeepDays) is left untouched so live analysis still has
  fresh loose files to work with.

  Designed to run unattended (Windows Task Scheduler). Idempotent: re-running
  appends stragglers to an existing day archive, re-verifies, and removes the
  loose copies. Never deletes anything without a verified archive (7z t == 0).

.PARAMETER CaptureDir
  Directory holding the loose req-*/resp-* capture files.

.PARAMETER ArchiveDir
  Where per-day .7z archives are written. Default: <CaptureDir>\archive.

.PARAMETER SevenZip
  Path to 7z.exe.

.PARAMETER KeepDays
  Number of most-recent UTC days to leave loose (including today).
  1 = archive everything strictly before today (default).

.PARAMETER WhatIf
  Show what would be archived/deleted without changing anything.

.NOTES
  Installed on this machine as the nightly Task Scheduler job
  "ClaudishCaptureCompaction" (daily 02:47 local — moved off 04:17 on
  2026-08-20: the 60-70 min run collided with the 04:00 container restart —
  runs as the interactive user, StartWhenAvailable to catch up missed runs).
