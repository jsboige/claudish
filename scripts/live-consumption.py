r"""live-consumption.py — consumption snapshot by machine:workspace:session (Epic #41 v0).

Consolidates the 2026-10-02 bricks (decompose_minimax.py, multiday_7z.py) into
the ONE dimension the committed organs did not already cover. The consolidation
was done the way this repo defines it — each brick function analysed, then
matched against what already ships, so that only the real gap is written here:

  subagent / cron ventilation             billing-header parse, semantics reused
                                         from native-consumption.py (see trap 1)

Three traps encoded, all measured in this repo:

1. The subagent flag lives in the x-anthropic-billing-header SYSTEM block, NOT
   in `metadata.user_id`. Measured by ai-01's review of this script (#334 B1)
   on the 60 most recent req-* captures: `user_id` parses to exactly
   `(account_uuid, device_id, session_id)` and NEVER carries `is_subagent` —
   the first version of this script read it there, every line reported 0/0,
   and its synthetic fixtures had fabricated the shape they believed. The
   flag has THREE states, parsed from the billing-header segment only:
   `cc_is_subagent=true` -> subagent; header present without the flag ->
   main; header absent -> unknown (never guessed from anywhere else).
   The cc_workload=cron ventilation rides the same segment. Per-request
   stamp caveat (native-consumption.py trap 8): cron is stamped on the
   requests a cron fired, NOT on the whole session — "not cron here" is
   "this request was not stamped", never "a human is driving".
2. `system` is serialized AFTER `messages`: on a big capture the billing
   header sits in the dropped middle, past the 512K head and unreachable to
   the 128K tail through `tools[]` (~134K measured for #99). The header is
   therefore looked up in the capped read FIRST, then, on a miss, by a
   CHUNKED whole-file scan (`bytes.find` per block — no full load, no regex
   over the file). The found-rate is published in the digest so a silent
   depth regression is visible.
3. (pid, reqN) is not unique — the counter restarts with the container — so
   the key maps to a DATED LIST and the join picks the latest candidate that
   precedes its response. `metadata.user_id` still yields the SESSION id (the
   one thing it really carries); a user_id that does not parse is counted as
   `unattributed`, never guessed at.

The marker line can be ECHOED in conversation prose (a quoted capture inside
messages); the real system block is serialized after messages, so the LAST
occurrence in the file wins — same ordering argument as trap 2.

`Primary working directory` echoes are guarded the other way: only an
absolute path counts (Windows drive or POSIX root — containerized lanes send
POSIX paths, accepted since #334).

Read-only. Emits a JSON snapshot and a markdown digest; the markdown is what an
hourly task is meant to drop where a human will see it.
