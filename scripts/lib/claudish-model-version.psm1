# claudish-model-version.psm1 — model version watch (pure logic, no network, no
# docker — the ONE exception is Invoke-DrainDetachedRestart, which runs the
# drain's own -Detach parent synchronously; every path it touches is passed in)
#
# Mandate (user, 2026-10-02): an organ that watches the versions each provider
# actually offers, auto-repins ROUTING on MINOR bumps (same major), escalates
# MAJOR bumps for user arbitration, and notifies in every case.
#
# Scope, phase 1: the Codex/ChatGPT backend lane (the family where minor churn
# actually bites — gpt-6-sol -> gpt-6.1-sol measured 2026-10-02). The module's
# parsing/diff/edit logic is provider-agnostic; the runner adds providers as
# their /models surfaces are probed. Cascades (container env) and profiles are
# REPORT-ONLY here: repinning those needs a recreate and stays an operator act.
#
# Safety rules encoded (each one is load-bearing):
#   - Only the `routing` object of config.json is ever written; apiKeys and the
#     rest round-trip untouched, and a backup is taken before any write.
#   - A new id is repinned ONLY after an acceptance probe answered 200 — a
#     listed-but-unprobeable id never enters routing (deepseek lesson: probe
#     before trusting either direction).
#   - Unparseable config = refuse, never guess.
#   - Kill switch: <ClaudishHome>\model-version-watch.enabled must contain
#     'enabled' before anything runs (same consent-file discipline as
#     wedge-watch — a missing file means "do nothing", not "arm by default").
#
# Targets PowerShell 5.1 (scheduled tasks run powershell, not pwsh): no ??,
# no ?., no ternary.

    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Launch the drained restart through claudish-drain.ps1's OWN -Detach
        path (#352) and report the OUTCOME, never just the attempt.

        .DESCRIPTION
        The previous inline launch was a raw `Start-Process -ArgumentList`
        with an unquoted -Reason VALUE: Start-Process joins the array with
        spaces and does not quote (the same class claudish-engine's
        Invoke-DockerBounded documents), so the child received `-Reason
        model-version-watch minor repin (old id retired)`, every word after
        the first bound positionally, `(old` failed to convert for the
        drain's [int]$MaxWaitSec, and the child died at parameter binding
        with stderr uncaptured — the log said "launching" while no restart
        ever ran (#352, same silent-death shape as #312).

        This function runs the drain's OWN -Detach parent SYNCHRONOUSLY: that
        path quotes every forwarded argument itself, captures the child's
        stdout+stderr, and returns on the child's proof of life, handing us a
        countable exit code to branch on:
          0 = child alive (its START line was seen) — restart in flight;
          3 = launch failed — no drain is running, relaunching is safe;
          4 = mute child — do NOT relaunch, a second drain would race the
              first.
        The -Detach parent itself exits within its startup window (default
        45 s); the hidden drain child keeps running independently, so the
        synchronous wait here is bounded and cheap. $Log receives one line
        per message (the watch's $logTs contract); $WriteEvent receives
        (kind, family, detail) and is expected to call Write-VersionEvent.
        Both callbacks run in the CALLER's scope (scriptblocks bind to where
        they were defined), so $eventsPath and friends stay visible.
