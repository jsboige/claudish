<#
    claudish-engine — shared, testable primitives for the watchdog and the drain.

    This module exists because of 2026-09-20. The Docker Desktop localhost
    forwarder (`wslrelay`) wedged three times that day on the hub machine, and
    the first attempt to automate a recovery caused a WORSE outage than the
    wedge it targeted: it tore down the Docker backend and the WSL VM, then
    could not relaunch Docker Desktop, leaving the host with no engine at all.

    The root cause of that failure is still present on `main` and is fixed here:
    `Register-ScheduledTask` has NO `-LogonType` parameter (it belongs to
    `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal`), so `Start-DockerEngine`'s relaunch has never
    worked on any machine — it has always thrown, been swallowed by its own
    catch, and logged "could not launch Docker Desktop". That is also the most
    likely explanation for 2026-08-29, when the hub came back from a reboot with
    no container and a human had to reboot a second time.

    Three rules are encoded here rather than written down, because a rule that
    lives only in a doc gets re-broken:

      1. NO TEARDOWN WITHOUT A PROVEN REBUILD. Test-EngineRelaunchReady does not
         inspect intentions — it registers the relaunch task and reads it back.
         A teardown is permitted only after that proof succeeds IN THE SAME
         PROCESS. The 13:18 failure is unreachable by construction: the
         registration that blew up is now the thing that must succeed first.
      2. A GUARD IS AN EXPLICIT FLAG, NEVER AN ACCIDENTAL EQUALITY. The previous
         attempt disarmed itself with `if ($loopbackUrl -ne $ProxyUrl)`, which
         held only because the two strings happened to be equal on a machine
         that had not opted in. Changing the probe from `localhost` to `[::1]`
         made equality impossible, and the watch armed on every machine at once.
         Opt-in is now a file with required content.
      3. EVERY UNKNOWN FAILS SAFE. Each instrument that lied that day now
         degrades to "do nothing" rather than to a verdict.

        Why a file and not a constant: on po-2025 the wedge kills ONLY the
        loopback path — com.docker.backend's [::]:3000 wildcard keeps serving
        127.0.0.1, the LAN and the ARR throughout. A watchdog that probes the
        dead path concludes the proxy is down and restarts the container, which
        fixes nothing (measured: 13 consecutive useless restarts over 6h47).
        Probing the SURVIVING path instead makes the watchdog agree with reality.

        No file = localhost = zero change. That is the default on every machine
        that has not opted in, and it is why this is safe to ship fleet-wide.

        wslrelay owns [::1]:<port> alone; com.docker.backend owns the [::]
        wildcard and keeps serving 127.0.0.1. .NET 5+ (pwsh 7) connects to
        `localhost` in dual-mode with a fast IPv6 -> IPv4 fallback, so a
        `localhost` probe answers 200 over 127.0.0.1 straight through the
        outage — blind to the exact wedge it exists to catch. A Node client,
        which resolves ::1 first, takes an immediate ConnectionRefused.

    return ('http://[::1]:{0}' -f $Port)
}

function Test-LoopbackListener {
    <#
        Is anything LISTENING on [::1]:<port>?

        This is the discriminant that keeps the wedge watch from crying wolf on
        machines that do not route localhost through a WSL relay: no [::1]
        listener means there is nothing to wedge, and the watch stays silent
        instead of logging a false banner every 15 minutes.

        It also fails safe through a known instrument trap. Under
        networkingMode=mirrored, listening sockets live in the mirrored WSL
        netns and the Windows TCP table never enumerates them, so this returns
        $false — "not visible", which is NOT "not serving". Returning $false
        routes the decision to 'none', i.e. do nothing, which is the correct
        behaviour under an instrument that cannot see. (Reading an empty table
        as a verdict is what produced a published-then-retracted conclusion on
        2026-09-20 — the same class of error as counting armed failover cascades
        by NAME instead of by VALUE.)

function Test-HttpAlive {
    <#
        Did this address carry an HTTP request and return ANY status?

        The wedge signature is "TCP accepts, HTTP never answers". So the correct
        discriminant is the presence of a response, NOT a 200. Checking for 200
        produced a false wedge on the hub the first time this ran under the
        production interpreter: Windows PowerShell 5.1 (.NET Framework) sends a
        request to http://[::1]:3000/health that comes back **HTTP 400**, while
        pwsh 7 (.NET 7) gets 200 from the same address at the same moment. A 400
        proves the forwarder is working perfectly — it carried the request and
        brought back an answer — yet a 200-only check reads it as a dead
        loopback and would have logged a phantom wedge every 15 minutes, then
        escalated one that never existed.

        Interpreter-dependent formatting of a Host header is not a health
        signal. Only a transport failure — no response object at all — is.

        Requiring content is deliberate: an empty file created by an accidental
        New-Item or a stray redirect does NOT arm a teardown of the host's
        container engine. The previous attempt's guard was a comparison between
        two strings that merely coincided; when they stopped coinciding, the

        Pure and injectable because `quser` is LOCALIZED: on this fleet it

        keying on the word "Active" silently finds nobody. The session-name
        column is not localized, though — "console" and "rdp-tcp#N" are literals
        — so that is what this keys on. The ">" prefix marks the caller's own

        The account to relaunch Docker Desktop as.

        Not hardcoded: "$env:COMPUTERNAME\jsboige" on `main` is the same
        operator-hardcoding trap as the watchdog's log path, and it makes the
        relaunch wrong-by-construction on any machine whose operator is someone
        else. $env:USERNAME is useless here (under SYSTEM it is the machine
        account), so ask the OS who is actually logged on.

        Three probes, because the obvious one is not enough. Measured on the hub
        2026-09-20: Win32_ComputerSystem.UserName came back EMPTY, because it
        reports the CONSOLE session only and the operator was connected over
        RDP (rdp-tcp#1). Taking that empty answer at face value would have made
        the preflight fail forever and the whole recovery path dead code on the
        one machine it was written for — fail-safe, but useless. `quser` sees
        RDP sessions; the process-owner probe is the last resort and needs
        elevation, which the scheduled task (SYSTEM) has and a dev shell

        It answers one question: "if I tear the engine down right now, can I
        actually bring it back?" And it answers it by DOING the rebuild-path
        registration and reading the task back, not by reasoning about it.

        On 2026-09-20 the teardown half was tested and the rebuild half never
        was. Everything that was verified — the probe does not fire when
        healthy, four addresses at 200, one real cycle exiting 0 — was true, and
        none of it could have caught a rebuild that throws on its first
        statement. Proof of teardown is not proof of recovery.

        Returns @{ Ready = <bool>; Reason = <string>; Checks = @(...) }. Any
        check that fails, for any reason INCLUDING an unexpected exception,
