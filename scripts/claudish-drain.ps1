# Claudish — drain-then-restart (shared)
#
# A bare `docker restart` kills every in-flight SSE stream mid-body. Each client
# then reports:
#
#     API Error: Connection lost mid-response. The response above may be incomplete.
#
# and that agent turn is lost. The proxy never breaks a stream itself (there is
# no controller.error() in the codebase; every terminating path emits
# message_stop), so a client-visible mid-response drop means the process went
# away under it. Restarts are the main way that happens.
#
# Measured on the hub, 2026-08-23, 906 samples over 30 min: min 1, p50 5, p90 7,
# max 10, mean 5.1 — a loaded half-hour that never reached 0. A ~2-day
# population probe (2026-08-25, 92 364 samples) corrects that window: min 0,
# 4.62% of samples at zero, P(activeStreams hits 0 within 300s) = 57.5%
# (73.4% within 600s). The floor IS zero; lulls are just brief (mean 5.9s),
# so the drain must fire on the FIRST zero sample, without confirmation.
#
# Since PR #37 the proxy reports the count:
#     GET /health -> {"status":"ok","activeStreams":8,"uptimeSec":1132}
# which lets a restart pick its moment instead of guessing.
#
# TWO WAYS TO USE IT
#
# 1. Standalone — replace `docker restart claudish-proxy` in a scheduled task:
#      powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\claudish-drain.ps1 -Reason "daily 04:00"
#
# 2. Dot-sourced — reuse the functions from another script:
#      . "$PSScriptRoot\claudish-drain.ps1"
#      Invoke-ClaudishDrainedRestart -Reason "confirmed hang"
#
# 3. Deploying — a RESTART reloads neither the image nor .env, so shipping a
#    rebuilt image needs -Recreate (`docker compose up -d`) instead:
#      . "$PSScriptRoot\claudish-drain.ps1"
#      Invoke-ClaudishDrainedRestart -Reason "deploy vX.Y" -Recreate
#    Same drain, different action. Plain `docker compose up -d` would deploy
#    the image just as well, but at the cost of every in-flight agent turn.
#
# Targets PowerShell 5.1: scheduled tasks run `powershell`, not `pwsh`.
#
# READING drain.log
# - Timestamps are LOCAL time on the hub host (UTC+2 in summer), with no Z
#   marker — Get-Date at line 43. A Z-less local time is not a UTC time:
#   shift +2 before comparing against UTC-probe data.
# - "restarting at N in flight" is a LOWER BOUND on the clients interrupted,
#   not the cost. $active is a single 2s-poll sample, already stale when the
#   `docker restart` command runs: any stream started in the gap, or any
#   connection refused during the outage, is uncounted. Demonstrated live by
#   the first graceful restart (2026-08-27 02:05Z): drain.log wrote
#   "restarting at 2 in flight" while the probe measured 3 streams interrupted
#   across the same 12s outage — N is a minimum, the true cost is higher.
#
# RUNNING IT UNDER A SCHEDULED TASK
# The task's ExecutionTimeLimit must cover the drain budget, and the two move
# together. Incident 2026-08-26: with ObserveSec=300 and a PT5M limit, the
# scheduler killed the script exactly at the observe boundary — the adaptive
# phase and the `docker restart` NEVER ran, and the 04:00 restart silently
# did not happen (LastTaskResult=0, uptime 32h35). Raised to PT15M. Only the
# budget and the limit together reach `docker restart`; changing either alone
# recreates the silent non-restart.

        Restarts the container at the quietest moment it can find.

        Phase 1 — wait for a TRUE zero. The hub's floor is zero (92 364-sample
        population probe, 2026-08-25: min 0, 4.62% of samples at zero) and a
        zero arrives within 300s on 57.5% of restarts (73.4% within 600s).
        During $ObserveSec the target stays at -1, so ONLY an activeStreams==0
        sample breaks the loop — a zero-cost restart. Lulls are brief (mean
        5.9s), so we fire on the first zero sample without confirmation:
        confirming costs a whole lull.

        Phase 2 — adaptive fallback for the ~43% unfavorable draws. After
        $ObserveSec with no zero, the target becomes the observed $seenMin and
        each subsequent miss relaxes it by one every $RelaxSec, which bounds
        the wait: the restart lands at a below-average moment instead of a
        random one. Replaying the 2026-08-23 samples, this adaptive stage
        alone shaved per-restart cost from mean 5.19 (blind docker restart)
        to 3.65, worst 10 -> 6. Relaxing faster undoes the gain (mean 4.67).

        Budget: $MaxWaitSec defaults to 600 — 300s of true-zero wait, then
        ~300s of adaptive search. The 04:00 daily restart can afford 10 min.
