# Claudish — drain-then-restart (shared)
#
# A bare `docker restart` kills every in-flight SSE stream mid-body. Each client
# then reports:
#
#     API Error: Connection lost mid-response. The response above may be incomplete.
#
# and that agent turn is lost. The proxy never breaks a stream itself (there is
# no controller.error() in the codebase; every terminating path emits
# message_stop), so a client-visible mid-response drop means the process went
# away under it. Restarts are the main way that happens.
#
# Measured on the hub over 3080 samples spanning day and night: p50 5, p90 8,
# max 14, mean 4.9. The hub DOES fall idle, but rarely and briefly — five
# distinct silent episodes, one per ~88 min of observation, lasting 2 to 39
# seconds. So a restart usually costs turns; the question is how many.
#
# Since PR #37 the proxy reports the count:
#     GET /health -> {"status":"ok","activeStreams":8,"uptimeSec":1132}
# which lets a restart pick its moment instead of guessing. Waiting for silence
# alone is a bad bet — a 300s window catches an idle episode roughly 1 time in
# 18 — but it is not the impossible bet an earlier version of this comment
# claimed.
#
# TWO WAYS TO USE IT
#
# 1. Standalone — replace `docker restart claudish-proxy` in a scheduled task:
#      powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\claudish-drain.ps1 -Reason "daily 04:00"
#
# 2. Dot-sourced — reuse the functions from another script:
#      . "$PSScriptRoot\claudish-drain.ps1"
#      Invoke-ClaudishDrainedRestart -Reason "confirmed hang"
#
# Targets PowerShell 5.1: scheduled tasks run `powershell`, not `pwsh`.

function Invoke-ClaudishDrainedRestart {

        Restarts the container at the quietest moment it can find.

        NOT "waits for zero" — though zero does happen. Measured over 3080
        samples spanning day and night: p50 5, p90 8, max 14, mean 4.9, and
        five distinct idle episodes, one per ~88 min of observation, each
        lasting 2 to 39 seconds. A drain that waits only for 0 therefore times
        out roughly 19 times out of 20 and then restarts at an arbitrary
        moment — which is what the first version of this function did.

        So the target is relative, not absolute. We watch for $ObserveSec to
        learn what "quiet" means for this hub right now, then fire on the first
        sample at or below that observed minimum. Each subsequent miss relaxes
        the target by one, which bounds the wait without a timeout deciding for
        us: the restart lands at a below-average moment instead of a random one.

        Replaying all 3080 real samples through each version, per restart:

                                  mean   p90   worst   restarts cutting nobody
            blind restart         4.86     7      11              0.3%
            wait-for-zero drain   4.76     7      14              5.2%
            this function         3.03     5       7              6.6%

        The defaults are the knee of that curve. A longer cap buys nothing
        (600s scored identically to 300s), and relaxing the target faster
        undoes the whole gain — at one step per poll the target outruns the
        hub and the mean goes back to 4.67.

        This shaves the cost; it does not remove it. Even at its best it cuts
        three agent turns per restart, so the real mitigation is restarting
        less often, not draining better.
