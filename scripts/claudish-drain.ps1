# Claudish — drain-then-restart (shared)
#
# A bare `docker restart` kills every in-flight SSE stream mid-body. Each client
# then reports:
#
#     API Error: Connection lost mid-response. The response above may be incomplete.
#
# and that agent turn is lost. The proxy never breaks a stream itself (there is
# no controller.error() in the codebase; every terminating path emits
# message_stop), so a client-visible mid-response drop means the process went
# away under it. Restarts are the main way that happens.
#
# Measured on the hub, 2026-08-23, 906 samples over 30 min: min 1, p50 5, p90 7,
# max 10, mean 5.1 — a loaded half-hour that never reached 0. A ~2-day
# population probe (2026-08-25, 92 364 samples) corrects that window: min 0,
# 4.62% of samples at zero, P(activeStreams hits 0 within 300s) = 57.5%
# (73.4% within 600s). The floor IS zero; lulls are just brief (mean 5.9s),
# so the drain must fire on the FIRST zero sample, without confirmation.
#
# Since PR #37 the proxy reports the count:
#     GET /health -> {"status":"ok","activeStreams":8,"uptimeSec":1132}
# which lets a restart pick its moment instead of guessing.
#
# TWO WAYS TO USE IT
#
# 1. Standalone — replace `docker restart claudish-proxy` in a scheduled task:
#      powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\claudish-drain.ps1 -Reason "daily 04:00"
#
# 2. Dot-sourced — reuse the functions from another script:
#      . "$PSScriptRoot\claudish-drain.ps1"
#      Invoke-ClaudishDrainedRestart -Reason "confirmed hang"
#
# 3. Deploying — a RESTART reloads neither the image nor .env, so shipping a
#    rebuilt image needs -Recreate (`docker compose up -d`) instead. Both forms
#    carry it (#124 — the standalone path used to drop the switch and silently
#    drain into a plain restart):
#      powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\claudish-drain.ps1 -Reason "deploy vX.Y" -Recreate -EnvFile "D:\claudish-shadow\.env"
#      . "$PSScriptRoot\claudish-drain.ps1"
#      Invoke-ClaudishDrainedRestart -Reason "deploy vX.Y" -Recreate -EnvFile "D:\claudish-shadow\.env"
#    Same drain, different action. Plain `docker compose up -d` would deploy
#    the image just as well, but at the cost of every in-flight agent turn.
#    -EnvFile is REQUIRED alongside -Recreate: docker compose interpolates
#    every ${VAR:-} in docker-compose.yml from its env file, and the hub keeps
#    the real one OUTSIDE the compose dir — a bare recreate re-created the
#    container with every CLAUDISH_FAILOVER_* empty (incident 2026-09-07,
#    cascades silently gutted). The compose dir's own .env is NOT trusted
#    either: on the hub it holds only CLAUDISH_PROXY_KEY. The script refuses
#    the recreate without a passing -EnvFile, before spending a drain.
#
# Targets PowerShell 5.1: scheduled tasks run `powershell`, not `pwsh`.
#
# READING drain.log
# - Timestamps are LOCAL time on the hub host (UTC+2 in summer), with no Z
#   marker — Get-Date at line 43. A Z-less local time is not a UTC time:
#   shift +2 before comparing against UTC-probe data.
# - "restarting at N in flight" is a LOWER BOUND on the clients interrupted,
#   not the cost. $active is a single 2s-poll sample, already stale when the
#   `docker restart` command runs: any stream started in the gap, or any
#   connection refused during the outage, is uncounted. Demonstrated live by
#   the first graceful restart (2026-08-27 02:05Z): drain.log wrote
#   "restarting at 2 in flight" while the probe measured 3 streams interrupted
#   across the same 12s outage — N is a minimum, the true cost is higher.
#
# RUNNING IT UNDER A SCHEDULED TASK
# The task's ExecutionTimeLimit must cover the drain budget, and the two move
# together. Incident 2026-08-26: with ObserveSec=300 and a PT5M limit, the
# scheduler killed the script exactly at the observe boundary — the adaptive
# phase and the `docker restart` NEVER ran, and the 04:00 restart silently
# did not happen (LastTaskResult=0, uptime 32h35). Raised to PT15M. Only the
# budget and the limit together reach `docker restart`; changing either alone
# recreates the silent non-restart.
#
# WORST-CASE WALL TIME (#233 AC4)
# ObserveSec 300 + adaptive up to 300 + compose stop grace 120 + settle 20
# ≈ 12.5 min — beyond a typical agent tool-call cap (10 min). Agent callers
# MUST run this DETACHED via -Detach, never inline inside a capped tool call:
# a caller killed mid-compose leaves the old container stopped with no
# rename/start ever issued — the 2026-09-23 09:35Z gap (16 min) is exactly
# that shape (#233). Full invocation:
#
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\claudish-drain.ps1 `
#       -Detach -Reason <why> [-Recreate -EnvFile <path>] [-ClaudishHome <dir>]
#
# -Detach relaunches this script as a hidden child (always powershell.exe,
# the interpreter the scheduled tasks run) with every argument quoted,
# captures the child's stdout+stderr to drain-detach-*.log under the Claudish
# home, and returns on the child's own `START pid <pid>` line in drain.log:
#   exit 0 = child alive (poll for the first OUTCOME line AFTER that START —
#            OUTCOME lines carry no pid and older ones belong to past runs),
#   exit 3 = no drain is running — the child died (rc + stdout/stderr tails
#            printed) or the launch itself failed (start-failed); relaunching
#            is safe,
#   exit 4 = no START line within -DetachStartupTimeoutSec while the child
#            may STILL be running — do NOT relaunch, inspect the stderr
#            capture named in the output.
# Known limit, loud by design: a -Reason VALUE that starts like a parameter
# name ("-Recreate …") makes the child die at parameter binding — exit 3 with
# the binding error in the stderr capture, never a silent no-op.
# ⚠ Sandboxes: -ClaudishHome alone is NOT enough — without -LogPath, the
# drain log resolves to $USERPROFILE\.claudish\drain.log, i.e. PRODUCTION.
# Pass both, always (same trap class as the dot-source note at the -Detach
# parameter).
# Every child exit writes a terminal `OUTCOME` line, and a later run that
# finds a RECREATE with no OUTCOME after it logs `PREVIOUS RUN INTERRUPTED`.

        Restarts the container at the quietest moment it can find.

        Phase 1 — wait for a TRUE zero. The hub's floor is zero (92 364-sample
        population probe, 2026-08-25: min 0, 4.62% of samples at zero) and a
        zero arrives within 300s on 57.5% of restarts (73.4% within 600s).
        During $ObserveSec the target stays at -1, so ONLY an activeStreams==0
        sample breaks the loop — a zero-cost restart. Lulls are brief (mean
        5.9s), so we fire on the first zero sample without confirmation:
        confirming costs a whole lull.

        Phase 2 — adaptive fallback for the ~43% unfavorable draws. After
        $ObserveSec with no zero, the target becomes the observed $seenMin and
        each subsequent miss relaxes it by one every $RelaxSec, which bounds
        the wait: the restart lands at a below-average moment instead of a
        random one. Replaying the 2026-08-23 samples, this adaptive stage
        alone shaved per-restart cost from mean 5.19 (blind docker restart)
        to 3.65, worst 10 -> 6. Relaxing faster undoes the gain (mean 4.67).

        Budget: $MaxWaitSec defaults to 600 — 300s of true-zero wait, then
        ~300s of adaptive search. The 04:00 daily restart can afford 10 min.

        spaces without quoting anything, so a value with a space splits into
        N parameter bindings — the established cause of the 02/10 silent
        deaths. Building ONE pre-quoted string carries the quoting through.
        Inside the quotes, the Windows argument rule (CommandLineToArgvW):
        a backslash is special only before a double quote or at the closing
        quote, so those runs are doubled, and every double quote is escaped
        as \". Doubling quotes (the old claim, "the -File escape form") is
        NOT the rule the child's parser applies: a trailing backslash
        merged with the closing quote and swallowed the NEXT parameter
        (ClaudishHome), and an embedded quote swallowed everything after it
        (Recreate lost) — both measured in review of #338. The escaping is
        ONE pass — `(\\*)"` matches empty runs too, so a bare quote is
        escaped by the same replace (a second quote-escaping pass would
        re-escape the `\" it just produced; that double escape corrupted
        mixed backslash+quote values, re-review of #338, 4 entries
        measured with a real child).
        Mutation target for the Pester pin: reverting to a bare -join, the
        doubling form, or the two-pass escape must turn the real-child B3
        tests red.
