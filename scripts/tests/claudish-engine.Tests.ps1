<#
    Pester 5 suite for scripts/lib/claudish-engine.psm1.

    Run:  pwsh -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-Pester ./scripts/tests -Output Detailed"

    These tests exist because the 2026-09-20 engine-recovery attempt shipped to
    the production hub with no way to exercise its logic except a real wedge.
    Every branch that mattered was reachable only in prod, so the one that threw
    was found by the host losing its container engine.

    The suite is deliberately heavy on REGRESSION tests, each named after the
    specific way a real instrument lied that day. A test named after a defect is
    worth more than a test named after a function.
